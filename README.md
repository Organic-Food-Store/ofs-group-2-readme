### We have two main components, a server and a web/mobile client.

The source for both components can be found at the Github Organization Organic-Food-Store:

- [Github.com/Organic-Food-Store](https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store)
- [OFS-Client](https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-client)
- [OFS-NodeJS-Express-Server](https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-nodejs-express-server)

You can find their respective setup instructions and application guides on their repo readmes.

They are also both hosted, and can be found here:

- [OFS Client Firebase Host](https://organic-food-store.firebaseapp.com)
- [OFS Server Heroku Host](https://organic-food-store.herokuapp.com/api)

The instructional video to both locally set up and host the client and server can be found here:

[![Verify Steps with Client & Server Setup Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-client/master/dev/Capture.PNG)](https://www.useloom.com/share/0130bb002fcf408a908689f09be91490 "Verify Steps with Client & Server Setup Video")

#### [Client & Server Setup Video](https://www.useloom.com/share/0130bb002fcf408a908689f09be91490) - We recommend playing the video at 1.25x speed.

After the Client and and server are set up...

- You can test all the [API calls in the API Documentation](https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-nodejs-express-server/blob/master/README.md#api-paths-documentation) at the Server URL: [localhost:5000](localhost:5000)
- You can test the [Client Uses](https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-client#using-the-client) at the Server URL: [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)

###### Note: These localhost URLS will only work if everything was setup as instructed.

***Note: Whether local or hosted, the [app](https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-client) will only use the [organic-food-store.herokuapp.com/api](https://organic-food-store.herokuapp.com/api) for all serverside calls.***

To get an idea of how the use the client, please watch the client usage video:

#### [Client Usage Video](https://www.useloom.com/share/739067c114ad4c48ae03e894049d1407) - Note the client has been updated since time of recording.
